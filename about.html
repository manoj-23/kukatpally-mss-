         <p>
        Though they provided books to lakhs of students over the years, they saw the need to help the meritorious students who deserved higher education in the best colleges possible. They started a new initiative in 2012 to sponsor complete educational requirements for students who are meritorious as well as economically weak. Each year they conduct a scholarship exam for students from government schools and pick the toppers after evaluating each students’ socio economic status. A number of Medha’s associates stand behind this initiative and participate in all these activities. Today they have more than 600 students who have benefited from this programme who are studying in the best colleges and universities in Telangana. Each year they continue to take 100 students from the state of Telangana in India.
